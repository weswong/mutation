Fowards Time Simulation that adds mutations to each individual within the population at time t.
essentially a WF model

Time is measured in generations (specify generation size in the timestep paramter)

Assume constant mutation rate across entire genome. No mutation hotspot locations
Assumes infinite sites and infinite alleles model
Location of mutation not explicitly modeled, although it might be added later on

Things that are kept track of:
Strain ID and the mutations it carries 

Can output AFS
